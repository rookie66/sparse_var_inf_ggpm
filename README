*** 1. Required Packages ***

    GPML toolbox    http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/
    minFunc         http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Software/minFunc.html

Tested with GPML toolbox v3.4 and minFunc_2012. 

The GPML toolbox-compatible likelihood function likCumlog is included for use 
with ordinal regression.

*** 2. Overview ***

The function gen_gp_train performs training of a sparse generalized GP model via
coordinate ascent using minFunc except in the case where the fixed point 
procedure is specified. The inputs to gen_gp_train are the (model,data,params) 
triplet (described below) and an L x 2 cell array, meth, describing the L 
optimizations to be performed in one coordinate ascent loop.

The first column of meth specifies the objective function to be optimized with a
function handle (note, minFunc performs minimization of the objective function).
The second column specifies the options to provide to minFunc as a structure 
(see minFunc documentation for more information). In this way, each row of meth 
implicitly defines the optimization variables.

Where minFunc is expected to perform the optimization, the optimization 
variables should all be located within the params structure and the objective 
functions must be declared to take to accept three different sets of inputs as 
arguments and return the following outputs:

    input set 1:    initial vector, model, data, params
    output:         objective function value, 1st deriv. of objective function 
                    wrt/ input variables represented by the initial vector, and,
                    optionally, the Hessian of the objective function

    input set 2:    params
    output:         vector extracted from params

    input set 3:    vector, model, data, params, 1 (dummy argument)
    output:         params with vector placed appropriately within structure

The included objective functions and corresponding optimization variables are:

    f_obj_primal_m      variational mean under GGPM
    f_obj_primal_C      Cholesky factor of variational covariance under GGPM
    f_obj_primal_mC     variational mean and Cholesky factor of variational 
                        covariance under GGPM
    f_obj_primal_V      variational covariance under GGPM
    f_obj_laplace       mean and covariance under Laplace approximation
    f_obj_primal_h      GP mean and covariance parameters and likelihood 
                        function parameters under GGPM
    f_obj_laplace_h     GP mean and covariance parameters and likelihood 
                        function parameters under Laplace approximation

The fixed point optimization of the variational covariance is handled in its own
function, fp_opt, which takes the (model,data,params) triplet and, optionally, a
minFunc options structure as arguments.

gen_gp_train returns a structure describing the trained model with fields 
equivalent to the params structure of the (model,data,params) triplet.

The function gen_gp_predict takes the triplet (model,data,params) as arguments 
along with the Npred input locations to be predicted at and returns a structure 
containing the latent GP mean and variance and output mean and variance 
evaluated at the input locations:

predictions:
    x:              [Npred x D]             D-dim. input locations to predict at
                                            (Npred total locations)
    lp:             [Npred x 1]             predictive log probabilities at x
    f_mean:         [Npred x 1]             posterior GP mean evaluated at x
    f_var:          [Npred x 1]             posterior GP variance evaluated at x
    y_mean:         [Npred x 1]             output mean evaluated at x
    y_var:          [Npred x 1]             output variance evaluated at x


The triplet of Matlab structures (model,data,params) is used throughout the 
code. These structures are:

model:
    type:           [string]                %s_%s where the first string 
                                            specifies the data type ('sparse' or
                                            'sod') and the second string 
                                            specifies the likelihood model. 
                                            currently implemented models:
                                                gpc:    binary classification
                                                        w/ Bernoulli-logit

                                                        w/ cumulative logit

*** 3. Generalizing ***

To include a new likelihood function into the package requires adding the 
appropriate procedures to calculate the expectations of the 0th, 1st, and 2nd 
order derivatives of the log-likelihood to the calc_expf function.

The sparse vs. sod model types are handled by the implementation and do not 
require any extra coding effort on the part of the user.

*** 4. Demo ***

A demo of the code is provided. To run, the GPML toolbox and minFunc packages 
need to be on the Matlab path. If these packages are located as siblings of the
parent directory of this code, then startup.m can be run.

The demo performs either sparse variational inference or variational Gaussian
inference on a SoD. The fraction of data points to use as the inducing set or 
subset is an argument. Example usages:

sparse_var_inf_ggpm_demo('sod',0.1);    % var gauss inf on 1/10 of train data
sparse_var_inf_ggpm_demo('sparse',0.1); % sparse var inf on 1/10 of train data
sparse_var_inf_ggpm_demo('sod',1.0);    % var gauss inf on full train data

The optimization parameters for the coordinate ascent variables can be modified 
to further explore performance (e.g., hyperparameter optimization with CG 
instead of quasi-Newton).
