+   added an example containing the model, data, and params structures set up in
    the case of sparse GP ordinal regression (with the stocks dataset); in this 
    example, the hyperparameters have been tuned from a previous optimization;
+   modified gen_gp_predict to include field lp in output struct only if test 
    outputs provided as fifth argument (adjusted code in 
    sparse_var_inf_ggpm_demo to account for this); the log prob calculated with 
    gen_gp_predict on the test set data was only valid in the case of logistic 
    likelihood (it was only calculating the log prob of y = 0); was also wrong 
    in the case of gpo, but for a different reason; 
+   re-wrote the gpo hyperparameter initialization code so that an additional 
    helper function is not required (attempting to run init_hyp for the ordinal 
    likelihood was previously returning an error)
+   modified dimensions of output lp in likCumLog
+   moved likCumLog.m and sigmoid.m to util directory
+   added comments to fp_opt.m describing the returned matrix in params.var.C
+   added parameter check to sparse_var_inf_ggpm_demo

+   replaced likCumLog with a version that uses a better approximation for 
    log(pr) when pr is very small

5/25/15

+   faster version of random_sample.m (uses Matlab's randperm)
+   added SGD count experiment and data set
+   corrected calls to minFunc_rs in gen_gp_train and full_var_opt_dm_fpV (now
    call minFunc)

3/12/15

+   initial version
